### Welcome to my profile!

<h4>About me:</h4>
<p>I am a 3 year experienced developer, with big knowledge on health systems. For me collaboration is the key to the success. When I engage in projects, I employ the best communication and teamwork strategies to ensure the highest product quality. I enjoy teaching, but also learn from my team. In my spare time, I primarily study technology, engage in sports such as football and surf, and attend the gym. On Sundays, I rest with my loved ones.</p>
